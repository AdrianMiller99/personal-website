                            <p>Hi, I'm Adrian, a computer science student from Switzerland with a passion for blending creativity and technology. While coding is at the heart of what I do, my creative pursuits don't end thereâ€”I express myself through music by playing the piano and crafting digital art with 3D modeling in Blender.</p>

                            <p>I'm also an avid gamer who enjoys exploring virtual worlds, understanding game mechanics, and even developing my own game projects. My love for geography often finds its way into my hobbies, whether through strategy games, maps, trivia, or exploring my local geography on my bike.</p>

                            <p>I'm always looking for new challenges and projects that allow me to combine technology with creativity. Feel free to reach out if you share similar interests or just want to connect!</p>
